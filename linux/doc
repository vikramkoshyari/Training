	scp----------------------------

      	1->scp(secure copy):

		 scp, copy a file or directory:
		a-> From your local system to a remote system.
		b-> From a remote system to your local system.
		c-> Between two remote systems from your local system.



		usage:
		scp [OPTION] [user@]SRC_HOST:]file1 [user@]DEST_HOST:]file2
		here,
			option- such as cipher, ssh configuration, ssh port, limit, recursive copy etc.

			[user@]SRC_HOST:]file1 - Source file.

			[user@]DEST_HOST:]file2 - Destination file

		options are:
			-P - Specifies the remote host ssh port.
			-C - This option forces scp to compresses the data as it is sent to the destination machine.
			-r - This option tells scp to copy directories recursively.
		
			--->copy local file to remote system:
			ex - scp file.txt remote_username@10.10.0.2:/remote/directory
				here,
					remote_username = username on the remote server
					10.10.0.2 = server ip address
					/remote/directory = path of directory want to copy file to.
  

				-P - add port in which ssh of remote host is listening.

					ex- scp -P 2322 file.txt remote_username@10.10.0.2:/remote/directory

				-r - To copy a directory from a local to remote system, use the -r option:


					ex - scp -r /local/directory remote_username@10.10.0.2:/remote/directory

			-----> copy file from one host to another host.

				ex- scp user1@host1.com:/files/file.txt user2@host2.com:/files
					have to enter password for both remote account and file is directly transfer from host1 to host2.


				here,
					user1@host1.com:/files/file.txt = file from host1 or source file

					user2@host2.com:/files = desitnation host2

				To route the traffic through the machine on which the command is issued, use the -3 option:

					ex- scp -3 user1@host1.com:/files/file.txt user2@host2.com:/files
